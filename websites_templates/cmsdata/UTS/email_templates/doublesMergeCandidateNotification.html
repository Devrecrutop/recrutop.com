<p>[t]Dear {$candidateName},[/t]</p>

<p>[t]We have found more than one record of you in our database. We have now merged your records into one.
This means that if you had more than one password to login, only one is left that will work.
Below you can find a link with which you can directly login to your profile and change your password to the one you want to keep.
If you have used different e-mail addresses, the e-mail address via which you have received this e-mail serves now as your username.[/t]</p>

{if $showPassword}
<p>[t]Your current password is: {$password}[/t]</p>
{/if}

<p><a href="{$loginUrl}">[t]Click here to login to your profile.[/t]</a></p>

<p class="utsSignature">
[t]Regards[/t]<br>
{$consultantName}<br>
