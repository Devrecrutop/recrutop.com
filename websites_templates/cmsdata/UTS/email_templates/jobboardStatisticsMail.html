<p>[t]Dear client,[/t]</p>

<p>[t]As you know, OTYS works with Textkernel and Actonomy . They provide technology for CV extraction and intelligent search technology. There are some conditions for this technology for job boards. One of the most important points of OTYS is to help you become successful. We have therefore decided to use a model for job boards based on growth. We measure your actual Actonomy and Textkernel consumption, on this basis, we will inform the above parties . You will receive at the end of the year from them a bill for actual use. This model is cheaper for you than an annual price.[/t]</p>
