[t]Dear[/t] {$request.CandidateGivenName} {$request.CandidateFamilyNamePreposition} {$request.CandidateFamilyName},
</p>
<p>
[t]We are very enthousiastic about your CV and would like to invite you to make our online assessment. This will give us more insight in you as a person and makes it possible for us to find even better matching jobs.[/t]
</p>
<p>
[t]In a few minutes you'll receive an email from NewNerds with a link to your test page. Please use the link to start your online assessment.[/t]
</p>
<p>
[t]The assessments are managed by our testing partner NewNerds[/t] (<a href="http://www.newnerds.nl/">www.NewNerds.nl</a>). [t]We insure you that we will not disclose any test results to anybody without your explicit agreement.[/t]
</p>
<p>
[t]It is important that you answer the question "may the recruiter may see the test results" with yes. If you do not do so I will not receive the test results and I will not be able to inform you about the results. Also I will not be able to use the results of the test in finding a suitable job for you.[/t]
</p>
<p>
[t]With kind regards,[/t]
</p>
